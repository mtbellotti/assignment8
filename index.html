  <h1>Largest US Sportsbooks Join Forces</h1>
  <h2>The nations largest online operators are coming together to form a group dedicated to responsible gaming practices.</h2>

  <p>Seven of the nations largest gaming companies are joining forces to create a trade group to promote responsible gaming, and for the first time ever, will share information about problem gamblers. </p>

  <p>The seven operators — FanDuel,DraftKings,BetMGM, Penn Entertainment, Fanatics Betting & Gaming, Hard Rock Digital and bet365 — will form the Responsible Online Gaming Association, or ROGA, the group announced Wednesday. </p>

  <p>The members account for more than 85% of the legal online betting market in the United States. Collectively they have pledged more than $20 million to fund ROGA.</p>

  <p>“Im incredibly excited to move this forward and to really do some impactful things and to really expand the knowledge through the research and to create these evidence-based best practices and to really empower players with information,” said Jennifer Shatley, executive director of ROGA.

  <p>ROGA members commit to work together on issues ranging from education, responsible gaming best practices, conscientious advertising and marketing across the industry.</p> 

  <p>The new group will also create an independent clearinghouse, or database, that will allow them to share key information related to protection of consumers, though the details on how it would work arent yet clear.</p>
